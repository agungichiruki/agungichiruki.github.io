Hi, I'm Agung (agungichiruki), welcome to this small space. I'm a certified cybersecurity analyst, fullstact developer, GNU/Linux user, and enthusiast of all the things computer hacking.

I finally decide to create this blog to share my notes, tutorials, my own thoughts, and experiences about things related to technology.

My goal with this blog is, so that i don't forget what i have learned and (maybe) other people can also learn from what i wrote on this blog.

Oh, i almost forgot. I named this blog "NYX" afted the goddess Nyx from Greek mythology. ðŸ˜ƒ
